                    <p class="font-class-1 pt-29 max-width-col-7">This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing,
                        but set off at
                        once
                        toward the Red Queen. To
                        her surprise, she lost
                        sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p>
                    <p class="font-class-1 pt-35 max-width-col-7">For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking
                        out in all
                        directions
                        over the country -
                        and a most curious
                        country it was.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-35">Perfect for Your</h3>
                    <p class="font-class-2 pt-13 max-width-col-7">The method is this: in an acre of ground you bury, at
                        six inches
                        distance
                        and eight deep, a
                        quantity of acorns, dates,
                        chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are fondest then you drive.</p>
